Manga Reading Assistant .Net (C#)
=================================
This is the attempt to port a previous project from VB.NET to C# while learning to code.

The code is probably really awful.

There have been a few changes.
First the database moved from MSSQL (file based) to MSSQL CE to SQLite3. Along with this the database code changes from datasets to LINQ to simple query strings.

There is also a [C++ Port](https://github.com/kelsos/mra) of the application.
